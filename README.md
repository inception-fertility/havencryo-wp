# havencryo-wp

# Quick Notes:

I have been using Gatsby JS in conjunction with WordPress to begin development for this website.

# Gatsby JS:

In this repo, I have included the files that are available for edit (source file, and surrounding config files). There are other files, such as, "Node_Modules", that will not be needed to modify.

In order to setup your local environment, you have to run gatsby, then use the files in this repo. I ran gatsby by typing "npx gatsby new havencryo-wp" in the terminal. This will build a website using a starter default template. In this repo are the files within the src folder that I have made so far.

# WordPress site:

The WordPress site is currently hosted with WP Engine.
https://havencryo.wpengine.com/

I have already connected this WordPress website in the "gatsby-config.js" file. I have ensured that it is properly fetching data from the website - the menuItems are rendered directly from the WordPress website.
